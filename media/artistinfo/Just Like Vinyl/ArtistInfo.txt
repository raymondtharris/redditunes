quickly started practicing and writing new material. Information about the band's progress 
was revealed through Erak's Twitter and eventually a dedicated Just Like Vinyl Twitter. The 
quartet played their first live set on the 16th of June 2010 in a house in Seattle and entered 
the studio to record a debut LP on the 2nd of August. Just Like Vinyl released an unmastered 
version of new song 'Death of the Sheep' on their Facebook page on the 27th of September 2010, 
this is the group's first official recording. During their first tour in October of 2010, 
the band released their self-titled album. The album was released online in December of 2010.
