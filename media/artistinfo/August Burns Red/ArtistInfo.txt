August Burns Red is an American metalcore band from Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
Formed in March 2003, the band began their first performances while a majority
of the members were still attending high school, and soon began playing shows 
around Lancaster. The band name is derived from an incident involving their first 
vocalist, Jon Hershey.

The band is primarily known for their heavy breakdowns and odd-meter riffs. 
They state Between the Buried and Me, Misery Signals and Hopesfall as their 
main influences.
