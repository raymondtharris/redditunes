Periphery is a notable American progressive metal band from Bethesda, Maryland 
(by way of Baltimore, Maryland), formed in 2005.Periphery was formed by guitarist 
Misha Mansoor in 2005. He slowly gained a reputation on the internet, primarily 
via a regularly-updated Soundclick account, Meshuggah and John Petrucci forums, 
and the sevenstring.org message boards. Before and during Periphery's tenure in 
the metal scene, Mansoor developed a reputation for doing his own audio production, 
the majority of which was performed with a home computer and a Pod XT during this period. 
Mansoor has continued to update his personal project, Bulb, which preceded Periphery, 
often transferring songs between the two projects. Mansoor continues to be involved in 
a number of other musical projects, including Haunted Shores with Mark Holcomb, Being 
(a space-prog metal outfit), and Of Man Not of Machine with Elliot Coleman (Sky Eats 
Airplane) and Holcomb.
