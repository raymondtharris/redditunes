Karnivool are an Australian progressive metal band formed in Perth in 1997.
 The group currently consists of Ian Kenny on vocals, Drew Goddard and Mark
 Hosking on guitar, Jon Stockman on bass guitar, and Steve Judd on drums. 
Karnivool emerged from a band Kenny and Goddard formed during high school. 
Their two extended plays, 1999's Karnivool and 2001's Persona, and their 
2005 debut album Themata, possessed an alternative metal sound; their 2009 
follow-up Sound Awake developed a more progressive rock sound.
