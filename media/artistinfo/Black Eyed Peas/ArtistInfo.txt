The Black Eyed Peas are an American hip hop group, formed in Los Angeles, California in 1995.
The group is composed of rapper and multi-instrumentalist will.i.am, rappers apl.de.ap and Taboo,
and singer-rapper Fergie. Since the release of their third album, Elephunk, in 2003, the group 
has sold an estimated 27 million albums worldwide, 20 million singles and 47 million copies with 
both sales combined.In 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have ever simultaneously 
held the #1 and #2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, with their singles "Boom Boom Pow" and "I Gotta 
Feeling", with the next single "Meet Me Halfway" achieving similar success, from the album The E.N.D. 
Combined, these three singles also topped the chart for an unprecedented 30 consecutive weeks in 2009. 
The album later produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with "Imma Be", making the group one of 
few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album before being followed with 
"Rock That Body" which managed to peak in the Top 10 of Hot 100. "I Gotta Feeling" has become the first 
single to sell more than 1 million downloads in the United Kingdom.
