The Fall of Troy was an American rock trio from Mukilteo, Washington. The trio consisted 
of Thomas Erak (lead vocals, guitars, keyboards), Andrew Forsman (drums, percussion) and 
Frank Ene (bass, backing vocals) The trio was characterized by a technical, intricate style, 
known for Erak's sporadic guitar riffs and their alternation between clean vocals and harsh 
screams. Over the course of their career of about eight years, the group has released four 
full-length albums, one EP, and one single. Prior to The Fall of Troy's formation, when each 
member was about 17 years old, all three founding members were in another group named The 30 
Years War, who released two EPs.
