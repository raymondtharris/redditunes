TesseracT are a British progressive metal band formed in 2003.
They are currently signed to Century Media Records. TesseracT 
started out back in 2003 as an archetypal djent band in then-teenage 
Acle Kahney's bedroom as a side project to his main band, Fellsilent.
What started as an outlet for creativity and experimentation grew and 
Kahney posted clips of his technically heavy guitar work on forums such 
as Sevenstring.org, taking the feedback on board and gradually improving 
his technique. It was in this way that a community of bedroom 
producer-musicians were spawned and this new wave of progressive music 
was created, along with names such as Misha Mansoor (Periphery), Paul 
Ortiz (Chimp Spanner) and John Browne (Monuments), who was a bandmate 
of Kahney's in Fellsilent.
